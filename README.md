## Design

### Prospective Wireframes
The initial wireframes for this project were created using Balsamiq, for both mobile and desktop viewing. The layout was inspired by TicketMaster and EventBrite, in order to ensure ease of use and assess whether our design would be appropriate for the event finder application we had in mind. Please see screenshots below.

### Color Palette
For the color scheme, inspiration was taken from exisitng event finders, namely TicketMaster and Eventbrite. Both websites utilise a minimal color palette (Orange & white with Black text or blue & white), therefore we explored similarly minimal palettes which high contrasts to meet user accessibility requirements.

Using [PaletteMaker](#https://palettemaker.com), we examined available color palettes and how they would present on different devices, and a prospective palette was 'Play Dough'. The idea was to use #4B3D8F as the base, background color and a white color for the main page where the events would be listed, alongside white text.

It follows the classic, minimalist palette used by other event finders, however it offers a 'funky' twist which can be experimented with and altered for a 'fresh' look, while retaining it's signature appearance - please see he screenshot below on the palette's adaptability over different devices (as showcased by PaletteMaker).

#### Contrast Checker
For this color palette, the contrast check with #4B3D8F and white text returned a 8.89 ratio - exceeding the minimum required 4.5.
