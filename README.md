# Where2
For this Hackathon, the aim was to develop an Event finder website using the Django web framework. Inspired by traditional event finders like TicketMaster and Eventbrite, this application includes CRUD functionality,  the option to search for events....

## User Experience (UX)

### Objectives
The objective of this hackathon project was to:

* Develop a user-friendly interface using an intuitive and responsive web application that allows users to easily search for and view events based on criteria such as location, date, category, or keywords.

*Implement robust backend functionality using Python web framework (e.g., Django) to design a secure and scalable backend that handles user authentication, event data storage, and efficient querying.

* Integrate external APIs to fetch real-time event information and display it dynamically on the platform.

* Allow users to create accounts amd save favorite events.

* Optimize the application for both desktop and mobile devices by implementing responsive design principles and testing across various browsers.

These objectives were created using Perplexity.ai.

## Agile Practice 

## Design

### Prospective Wireframes
The initial wireframes for this project were created using Balsamiq, for both mobile and desktop viewing. The layout was inspired by TicketMaster and EventBrite, in order to ensure ease of use and assess whether our design would be appropriate for the event finder application we had in mind. Please see screenshots below.

### Color Palette
For the color scheme, inspiration was taken from exisitng event finders, namely TicketMaster and Eventbrite. Both websites utilise a minimal color palette (Orange & white with Black text or blue & white), therefore we explored similarly minimal palettes which high contrasts to meet user accessibility requirements.

Using [PaletteMaker](#https://palettemaker.com), we examined available color palettes and how they would present on different devices, and a prospective palette was 'Play Dough'. The idea was to use #4B3D8F as the base, background color and a white color for the main page where the events would be listed, alongside white text. 

![Play Dough Palette](docs/readme/Play%20Dough.png)

It follows the classic, minimalist palette used by other event finders, however it offers a 'funky' twist which can be experimented with and altered for a 'fresh' look, while retaining it's signature appearance - please see he screenshot below on the palette's adaptability over different devices (as showcased by PaletteMaker).

#### Contrast Checker
For this color palette, the contrast check with #4B3D8F and white text returned a 8.89 ratio - exceeding the minimum required 4.5.

### Icons & Images

The images used for our event posts were taken from ..... 

In.order to make them in line with the requirements indicated in the Dev TTools (i.e. image sizing), they were minimised and scaled using...... 

#### Logo & Favicon 
The logo was intended to be easy to remember and memorable enough for the users to associate it with our event finder. For this, we chose a ...
